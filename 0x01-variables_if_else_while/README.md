- What are the boolean operators and - how to use them
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi` , `vim` , `emacs`.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` , using the options -`Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- There should be no errors and warnings during compilation.
- You are not allowed to us system.
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl).

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Uip4OgfLQdGP921TAMtCHQ), **without the help of Google**:

### General

- Why C programming is awesome
- who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type `gcc main.c`
- What is an entry point
- What is `main`
- How print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`
- How to get the of specific unary operator `sizeof`
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
- What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with `betty-style`
- How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library
- How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone elseâ€™s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### C

- Allowed editors: `vi` , `vim` , `emacs`.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` , using the options `-Wall -Werror -
Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation.
- You are not allowed to use `system`
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl).

### Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (*$ wc -l `file`* should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your file should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`

## Task Lists

- **0-preprocessor** - `Preprocessor` - a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
- **1-compiler** - `Compiler` - a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- **2-Assembler** - `Assembler` - a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
- **3-name** - `name` - a script that compile a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.
- **4-puts.c** - `Hello, puts` - a C program that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"`, followed by a new line.
- **5-printf.c** - `Hello, printf` - a c program that prints exactly `"with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art"`, followed by a new line.
- **6-size.c** - `Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation` - a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- **100-intel** - `Intel` - a script that generates the assembly code (lntel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- **101-quote.c** - `UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand it the simplicity`
